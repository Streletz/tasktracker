Download zip archive;  2. Extract the archive to a folder on the server;  3. Create database (if it is not already created);  4. Configure database connection;  5. Execute migrations and create the initial data.### CONFIGURE DATABASE CONNECTIONEdit the file `config/db.php`. Uncomment rows for your RTDBMS and write real data into, for example:```phpreturn [     /*MySQL*/    //'class' => 'yii\db\Connection',    //'dsn' => 'mysql:host=localhost;dbname=tasktracker',    //'username' => 'root',    //'password' => '',    //'charset' => 'utf8',    /*PostgreSQL*/    'class' => 'yii\db\Connection',    'dsn' => 'pgsql:host=localhost;port=5432;dbname=tasktracker',    'username' => 'postgres',    'password' => 'postgres',    'charset' => 'utf8',];```### CONFIGURE SMTP SERVER CONNECTIONEdit the file `config/web.php` with real data, for example:```php'mailer' => [            'class' => 'yii\swiftmailer\Mailer',            // send all mails to a file by default. You have to set            // 'useFileTransport' to false and configure a transport            // for the mailer to send real emails.            'useFileTransport' => false,            'transport' => [                'class' => 'Swift_SmtpTransport',                // Your SMTP server                'host' => 'smtp.example.com',                // Your user name                'username' => 'example@example.com',                // Your password                'password' => '*******',                // Your port                'port' => '465',                'encryption' => 'ssl'            ]        ],```Edit the file `config/params.php` with real data, for example:```php'mailer' => [            'class' => 'yii\swiftmailer\Mailer',            // send all mails to a file by default. You have to set            // 'useFileTransport' to false and configure a transport            // for the mailer to send real emails.            'useFileTransport' => false,            'transport' => [                'class' => 'Swift_SmtpTransport',                // Your SMTP server                'host' => 'smtp.example.com',                // Your user name                'username' => 'example@example.com',                // Your password                'password' => '*******',                // Your port                'port' => '465',                'encryption' => 'ssl'            ]        ],```### EXECUTE MIGRATIONSTo execute the migration and create the initial data, run the following commands in the console, for example: ```   cd var\www\myserverfolder    yii migrate --migrationPath=@yii/rbac/migrations/  yii migrate  yii rbac/init ```NOTE: The actual path to your folder on the server may differ from that shown in the example.WARNING: Starting from version 4.0.0, the order of migrations has changed! Be careful!## HISTORY### Version 4.0.0 - Adding the ability to prevent users from creating tasks for themselves (as a settings option); - Ability to enable and disable email notifications$ - New admin dashboard; - Added general settings - PostgreSQL support; - Bug fixing.### Version 3.0.0 - The tasks section has been moved to a separate module (its functions are still included in the package, this update applies only to the application architecture); - The notification of users about creating and editing tasks via email.### Version 2.0 - Highlight overdue tasks; - Updated the separation of access rights based on roles; - The admin panel is separated into a separate module. ### Version 1.0 - First version.
